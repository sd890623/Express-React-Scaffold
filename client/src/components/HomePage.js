				<p>
					Solid knowledge and experience on web development.
					I'm mostly experienced in front end development with React line, React+Redux+Antd, and standard front-end tech (HTML5, SASS, Bootstrap, Jest, webpack).
					My backend experience is mostly lying on PHP, using OO framework to deliver the backend in an efficient and well-tested way.
					>I have solid experience on two API standards, GraphQL and REST.
					And I will be more than happy to apply my academic knowledge to introduce machine learning to the products.
					I'm constantly using linux OS, apache, AWS and Git for work.
					I enjoyed my careerpath as a web developer as it provides more flexibility compared to native apps.
					About me?
					An optimistic and passionate developer always striving to be sharper in the industry.
					Great willingness to learn and expand beyond my comfort area but extremely cautious when implementing.
					Strong background with math.
