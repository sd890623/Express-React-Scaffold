#Code Test for Vicinity Center - By Daniel Sun

## Quick Start
### Just to check everything is working
```
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Start the project ( it will build the client, before starting the server )
npm start

# Open web browser at http://localhost:8080
# You will see the project
# The json data has been added to the repo.
```
#Notes
Even though I was told this project should take no more than 45 minutes, I've spent hours configuring the devepment environment (Which is the greater time cost in the project compared to coding itself).
I've forked from a react-express scaffold project to make my life easier 
https://github.com/arpitgo4/Express-React-Scaffold

However with the 45 minutes requirements, I believe not every my skills should be demonstrated in the project, for example:
BE: Object oriented design and testing.
FE: Jest, eslint, more complex webpack environment.
